To make the type checker, I used SableCC 3.7 and Eclipse for development.
All the scripts assumes SableCC 3.7 binary is in your PATH.

To run the script "run", be in /guillaume_labranche

For any other action, please be in /src
	To compile the SableCC grammar and the Java lexer/parser/typechecker/printer:
		make
	To clean (delete all .class, SableCC code)
		make clean
	Extra: To run the program on everything in /programs (this is set in /src/testfiles)
		make check
